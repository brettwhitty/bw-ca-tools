Patch for Adding 'SLURM' Grid Engine Support to Celera Assembler 'runCA' Script
===============================================================================

More details to be added here shortly...

Just run 'do_runCA_slurm_patch.sh' to get the dirty business going.

After that, you should have a shiny "new" 'runCA.pl' that will allow you to "Enjoy Slurm!"

There's a "test suite" under 'test-ca-slurm-patch' that should satisfy your concerns, or enhance them. See the README.md there for deets.

This stuff is by no means sufficiently tested, or production-ready.
